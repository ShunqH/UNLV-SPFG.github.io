Stephen Lepp is a Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
He joined UNLV from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
He got his PhD in 1984 from University of Colorado, Boulder and his undergraduate degree in Physics and Math from University of Minnesota, Duluth.

His research has focused on applications of Atomic and Molecular Physics to Astrophysics, though recently he has expanded his research into the field of Planetary Dynamics.

In Astrochemistry he has made models of the Interstellar Medium, the early universe, and supernova 1987a. In planetary dynamics he has investigated orbits around binary stars including the effects of General Relativity and around triple stars.
