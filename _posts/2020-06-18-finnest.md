Congratulations to [Shangjia Zhang](/team/zhang-shangjia/) for being awarded a [Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINNEST) Grant](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/future-investigators-in-nasa-earth-and-space-science-and-technology-finesst/){:target="_blank"} in the [Planetary Science Division](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=759880/solicitationId=%7BE16CD59F-29DD-06C0-8971-CE1A9C252FD4%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/ROSES19%20FINESST%20Planetary%20Science%20Selections%20(6%2030%202020).pdf){:target="_blank"} as a Future Investigator (FI).

Shangjia's proposal is titled "Self-consistent Dust and Thermal Structure in 3-D Protoplanetary Disk Models: Constraints on Disk and Young Planet Properties".
He will build models with consistent thermal structure of protoplanetary disks using Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D and radiation hydrodyanmics code [Athena++](https://www.athena-astro.app). These simulations will help explain diverse structures recently discovered by ALMA and ground-base observations. Since the thermal structure affects dynamics, a realistic implementation of radiation will improve our understanding of the disk dynamics too.

The grant provides up to $135,000 in three years covering the student's tuition and stipend. 34 proposals were selected among 341 proposals reviewed in the Planetary Science division this year.
