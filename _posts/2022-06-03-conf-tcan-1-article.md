This week, [Chao-Chin Yang](/team/yang-chao-chin/), [Stanley Baronett](/team/baronett-stanley/), and [Aleksey Mohov](/team/mohov-aleksey/) attended [_Planets in the Desert_](https://www.ufos-project.eu/dust-gas-drag-instability-code-comparison), the 1st in a series of workshops for the [TCAN collaboration](/awards/fund-award-tcan/).
The meeting agenda included a series of presentations and discussions on the [streaming instability](/research/planet-formation/#dust-gas-dynamics-and-planetesimal-formation) and goals to perform and compare codes and simulations of the dust and gas drag instabilities in accretion disks.
